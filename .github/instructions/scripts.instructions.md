# GitHub Copilot Agent Mode – Bash Shell Scripts Instructions

Copilot **MUST** comply with all instructions described in this document when editing or creating any bash shell scripts in this repository.

However, when there are conflicts between this document and `general.instructions.md`, **ALWAYS** prioritize the instructions in `general.instructions.md`.

---

## 🎯 Primary Goal

Develop high-quality, maintainable, and user-friendly Bash scripts that adhere to all specified best practices.

## 🛠️ Scripting Practices & Style

Apply the following style and best practices to all shell scripts:

- **Follow Standard Shell Style:**
  Use the [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html).

- **Style & Linting:**
  Ensure all scripts pass `shellcheck`.

- **Functions:**
  Keep functions **ideally between 10 to 20 lines**.

- **Line Length:**
  Keep line length **up to 120 characters**.

- **KISS Principle:**
  Keep implementations simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.

- **DRY Principle:**
  Factor out reusable, unexported helper functions.

- **Robust Script Settings:**
  Always start scripts with `set -euo pipefail`.

- **Modularization:**
  Source and reuse logic from helper scripts (e.g., `validation.sh`, `dependencies.sh`).

- **Defaults & Overrides:**
  Define default settings as `readonly` variables and allow overrides via CLI arguments or environment variables.

- **Comprehensive Argument Parsing:**
  Support both short/long option flags and ensure user-friendly `--help` and usage output.

- **Environment Variable Support:**
  Allow authentication and configuration via environment variables.

- **Dependency Checks:**
  Check that all required dependencies are installed before script execution.

- **Early Validation:**
  Validate user inputs early at the start of the script.

- **Error Handling & Exit:**
  On error, output a clear message and exit immediately.

- **Separation of Concerns:**
  Organize code into dedicated functions for argument parsing, environment setup, main logic, and output formatting.

- **Usage Documentation:**
  Provide clear usage/help text, including examples and variable descriptions.

- **POSIX & Portability:**
  Use POSIX-compliant syntax and avoid OS/locale-specific behavior.

- **User Feedback:**
  Give progress and completion feedback for a better user experience.

- **Additional Practices:**

  - Use clear, explicit, and consistent names.
  - Prefer constants over hardcoded values.
  - Prefer early returns, minimize deep nesting and loops.
  - Only write necessary, non-redundant comments.
